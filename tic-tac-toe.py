'''
This is an exploration of tic-tac-toe, where I try
to program the game using simple Python data structures.
Let's start with the board.  We'll represent it like
this:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
You could say that square 5 has coordinates (1, 1), but
we don't need that complication yet.
The two players are X and O.  Let's represent the progress
of a game as simply and clearly as we can:
[
    ('X', 5),
    ('Y', 1),
    ('X', 2),
]
Before we do anything, it's gonna be extremely useful to
be able to visualize any game.  We'll make it somewhat compact:
YX-
-X-
---
Let's write the code...
'''

SQUARES = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
CORNERS = {1, 3, 7, 9}
OPEN = '-'

def board_display(moves):
    squares = {s: OPEN for s in SQUARES}
    for player, square in moves:
        squares[square] = player
    display = ''.join([
        squares[1], squares[2], squares[3], '\n',
        squares[4], squares[5], squares[6], '\n',
        squares[7], squares[8], squares[9],
    ])
    return display

# Next, test it...

def clean_ws(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '').replace('\n', '')

def test_display():
    moves = [
        ('X', 5),
        ('Y', 1),
        ('X', 2),
    ]

    disp = board_display(moves)

    expected = """
YX-
-X-
---
"""

    print expected, disp

test_display()


'''
So far I feel pretty good about the game.  I haven't had
to do too much serious thinking yet about the game, and
I can at least visualize moves that are input to me.
Let me see if I can figure out if a game is over.  I'll
borrow an idea from Maydha and have a simple data structure
to represent the geometry of the game:
'''

TRIPLETS = dict(
    row1 = {1, 2, 3},
    row2 = {4, 5, 6},
    row3 = {7, 8, 9},

    col1 = {1, 4, 7},
    col2 = {2, 5, 8},
    col3 = {3, 6, 9},

    diag1 = {1, 5, 9},
    diag2 = {3, 5, 7},
)

'''
For any game I want to determine the winner, so I will have
a function that returns 'X' or 'O', or, if the game is not
yet done, then None.
'''

def winner(moves):
    for player in 'XO':
        my_moves = {square for p, square in moves
            if p == player}
        for squares in TRIPLETS.values():
            if squares.issubset(my_moves):
                return player # they won!
    return None

'''
The above code seems reasonable enough.  Before I test it,
I want a little helper function for testing.
This is a decent way to represent moves internally:
    [('X', 5), ('O', 3]]
It's awkward to type, though, so I want a new notation:
    X5O3
I can make that work!
'''

def expand(s):
    def moves():
        it = iter(s)
        while it:
            yield (next(it), int(next(it)))
    return list(moves())

assert expand('') == []
assert expand('X5') == [('X', 5)]
assert expand('X5O1') == [('X', 5), ('O', 1)]

# Ok, back to testing our winner function!

assert winner(expand('')) is None
assert winner(expand('X5')) is None
assert winner(expand('X5O1X4O2X6')) is 'X'
assert winner(expand('X5O1X4O2X9')) is None


'''
Let's take stock of what we have so far:
    - We have two simple ways to represent the moves
      in the game--one that's easy to program with
      and one that's easy to type.
    - We can display the board.
    - We can tell when somebody has won.
Let's make some other building blocks:
    whose_turn(moves)
    claimed_squares(moves, player)
    open_squares(moves)
'''

def whose_turn(moves):
    return 'XO'[len(moves) % 2]

assert whose_turn(expand('')) == 'X'
assert whose_turn(expand('X5')) == 'O'
assert whose_turn(expand('X5O3X2')) == 'O'

def claimed_squares(moves, player):
    return {square for p, square in moves
        if p == player}

assert claimed_squares(expand('X5O4X3'), 'X') == {5, 3}
assert claimed_squares(expand('X5O4X3'), 'O') == {4}

def open_squares(moves):
    claimed = {square for _, square in moves}
    return SQUARES - claimed

assert open_squares(expand('X5O4X3')) == {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}

'''
Ok, now let's start getting into real analysis of a tic tac toe
game.  A typical opening sequence goes like this:
    X5O1X2
    OX-
    -X-
    ---
We can tell a few things here:
    - row1 is a stalemate
    - col1 is in O's favor at the moment
    - col2 is a THREAT for O
    - nobody's won yet
Let's see if we can build a game_state data structure that looks
something like this:
    dict(
        row1 = {'X': 1, 'O': 1},
        row2 = {'X': 1, 'O': 0},
        ...
        diag2 = {'X': 1, 'O': 0},
    )
We'll build it from the bottom up...
'''

def triplet_status(triplet_name, moves):
    squares = TRIPLETS[triplet_name]
    def count(player):
        return len(claimed_squares(moves, player).intersection(squares))

    return {player: count(player) for player in 'XO'}

assert triplet_status('row1', expand('X5O1X2')) == {'X': 1, 'O': 1}

    diag2 = dict(X=1, O=0),
)

'''
Now let's put ourselves in X's shoes.  For the opening move,
X wants to move in the center, because then they will have
"representation" in four different triplets: row2, col2,
diag1, and diag2.
Let's write a function for that.
'''

    return {
        triplet_name

    }

assert triplets_represented(expand('X5'), 'X') == \
    {'row2', 'col2', 'diag1', 'diag2'}


'''
Let's start off by saying that player O wants to use the same
strategy, which is basically to maximize the number of triplets
that they "represent" on the board.
Let's write a little one-off analysis function for this...
'''

def analyze_options(prior_moves, player):
    def outcome_for_square(square):

    4: 2,       6: 2,
    7: 3, 8: 2, 9: 3,
}

'''
The assert statement above is a little hard to read,
but it basically demonstrates this to "O":
    - if they move on a corner, they represent on 3 triplets
    - if they move on an edge, they only get 2 triplets
Let's implement a greedy strategy, where O simply
maximizes their representation.  Since O is gonna have
four equally good choices after X moves in the center,
we'll break the tie by picking the square with largest
number, so O will move to square 9, the bottom right
corner.

with a 2-0 advantage on some triplet, which means imminent
defeat.

So I ran the above code, and O fights X to a draw.  I pasted

-X-
X-O dubious move by X
--O O had to block
-X-
X-O
--O
-XX X had to block
X-O
--O
OXX O had to block
X-O
-XO good move by X if O does something stupid
OXX
X-O
-XO
OXX
XOO O blocks
XXO the game is over, but X fills in the last square anyway :)
OXX
XOO
So after all this, we see that O has learned to play reasonably well
against an opponent who only made one possible blunder.
What happens if X moves wisely too?
